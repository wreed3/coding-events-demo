# coding-events-demo


1. The purpose of this application would be to allow a person to be able to create an account
that would allow them to follow many different  meet-up events that interest them. 
It would be organized in a calendar view that would name the events on the dates that they 
are being held on the calendar. 

2. The current state of the application only allows the user to create, delete, view, and add tags
onto events. You can also create event categories and tags. The tags can additionally be added 
on events.

3. To enhance the application to fulfil the purpose of the application, these updates would be added for future improvements:
A Person class would be added that would allow them to create an account and follow events on a calendar. An account class 
and an account details class would also be added to the application. The account class would be linked to each person that signed up.
The Account details would be linked to each accounta provide further details to the accounts features and the persons event interests. 
A Calendar view would be created to allow the person to view the events that they decided to follow outlined on their account. 
The calendar would have events on the particular dates the meet-up's would be held. When the particular events are clicked it 
would refer to the events detail page to provide the full details of the event.
